For this project, for times sake, I would most likely focus on the continental United States, possibly even just the state of utah. This API gives me access to helicopter landing pads acrossthe world. Theoretically, the advantage a helicopter provides over a plane is that it can land in more remote locations, is quicker to unload, and is faster in takeoff and landing. Therefore, it would be possible to make an application where there is a list of preplanned remote-evac sites(I'm aware that life-flights and search and rescue -flights often don't land and can use a winch to hoist people up on a stretc
her). But for say for remote home-steaders in the Fish-Lake, Unita, or HenryMountians, if a bad wildfire happened, or a group of hunters got injured, this app could be extremely useful for a rescue or medevac pilot. Ideally, my fucntion could intake coodrinates for the people needing evac, and the program would output the nearest landind pad. I would make a class for no-go criteria for weather, which could return a boolean, since the only real no-go is a harsh blizzard with immense wind(in the realm of this project).
